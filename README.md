# Vaccine-Adoption-to-Prevent-Covid-Outbreaks
<br/>
By looking at county demographic features such as education, income, age, gender, race, religion, political affiliation, and other social factors and behaviors, health professionals can develop strategies for overcoming vaccine hesitancy with the goal of developing local herd immunity. Preventing COVID outbreaks is the best way to stimulate local economies, and vaccination is key to that effort.
